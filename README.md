### Using within a project
Using `changelog-light` within a project requires one primary thing... formatting your commit messages using [conventional commit types](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)

This project leverages this [conventional commit types resource](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json) to determine
how `CHANGELOG.md` is generated.

#### How it works
`changelog-light` doesn't use tags. Focusing on tags to determine what gets generated works in some environments.

Since handling tags was unnecessary for our purpose, we kept it simple. Instead, `changelog-light` looks for the
last commit message, of a specific type, to determine the range of commits...

   ```
   chore(release): [semver version format]
   ```

#### Example NPM script
Using within a project you could apply `changelog-light` as a NPM script in `package.json`

   ```js
   "scripts": {
     "release": "changelog"
   }
   ```


#### How to use
Assuming you're using GitHub as your base. _If you're not using GitHub we do expose the url paths used to generate the log._

1. First, git checkout the branch you want to run `changelog-light` on
1. Next, run the CLI, either directly, or through a NPM script like the above example.

   ```
   $ changelog --dry-run --non-cc
   ```
   _We recommend you try the `--dry-run` and `--non-cc` options for your first run._

1. Review the output, you have a few choices
   - in your terminal only, see option `--dry-run`
   - or as a commit with a `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` update. This is the default option `--commit`
   - or as updated files `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`, if you opted to update without a commit, see option `--commit=false`
1. That's it!

## Credit
This project is influenced by the now deprecated project [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version). 

The primary differences between [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) and this project
are the weighting assigned to commit message types and a fraction of the features.
